# unsloth/QVQ-72B-Preview-bnb-4bit Cog model

This is an implementation of [unsloth/QVQ-72B-Preview-bnb-4bit](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/QVQ-72B-Preview-bnb-4bit) as a [Cog](https://github.com/replicate/cog) model.

## Development

## Basic Usage

To run a safe user prediction:

    cog predict -i image=@pelicans.jpg -i prompt="How many pelicans are there in the picture?"

Output

    So I'm looking at this image, and it's quite serene. It seems like a coastal scene with the ocean and some land in the background. The sky is a mix of blue and purple hues, which might suggest that it's either early morning or late evening. The water is calm, with gentle ripples, and there are some reflections of the sky on the surface.

    In the foreground, there are what appear to be pelicans. They're large birds with long beaks and throat pouches, which are characteristic features of pelicans. They seem to be perched on the water, possibly resting or looking for food. Their feathers are mostly grayish, blending in with the muted tones of the scene.

    The background shows a coastline with some vegetation, maybe dunes or low-lying plants that are typical of beach environments. The land extends into the distance, where it meets the horizon.

    Overall, the atmosphere of the image is peaceful and natural, with no signs of human activity. It captures a moment in the life of these birds in their natural habitat.

    Now, to answer the question: How many pelicans are there in the picture?

    Looking closely, I can see several pelicans scattered across the water. Counting them one by one, I have:

    1. One pelican near the center of the image, slightly to the left.

    2. Another pelican to the right of the first one, a bit further away.

    3. A third pelican below these two, closer to the bottom of the image.

    4. A fourth pelican to the left, near the edge of the photo.

    5. And finally, another pelican towards the top right corner.

    So, adding them up: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.

    Therefore, there are five pelicans in the picture.

    Wait a minute, I should double-check that. Let me go through again.

    Starting from the left side of the image:

    - There's one pelican close to the left edge.

    - Moving rightward, there's another pelican near the center.

    - Then, another one slightly to the right of the center.

    - And one more towards the right edge.

    - And, yes, another one up higher, near the top right.

    That's still five pelicans.

    Alternatively, maybe some of them are overlapping or partially obscured.

    Let me see if there are any more pelicans hidden in the water or behind others.

    Hmm, I don't see any additional pelicans. The water is pretty clear, and the birds are spaced out enough that I don't think any are being completely hidden.

    So, I'm confident that there are five pelicans in the picture.

    Just to be thorough, I'll scan the entire image once more.

    Left to right, top to bottom, counting each pelican as I see it.

    Left edge: one.

    Center left: two.

    Center: three.

    Right center: four.

    Top right: five.

    No, that's all of them. Five pelicans in total.

    I think that's the answer.

    **Final Answer**

    \[ \boxed{5} \]
